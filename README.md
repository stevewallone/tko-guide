# TKO Workshop Guides 

Before or after attending each TKO workshop, participants may use the guide here 
to preview or review the content of the workshop. Previewing a workshop guide provides familiarity
with the task and makes the student more efficient when performing the workshop. While
reviewing a workshop guide will reinforce the technologies just learned at the workshop.

Each workshop guide is independent of each other and may be viewed in any order you like.

The TKO guides here may be used as a reference that is available anytime, 
while the workshop content is only available during the actual workshop.
